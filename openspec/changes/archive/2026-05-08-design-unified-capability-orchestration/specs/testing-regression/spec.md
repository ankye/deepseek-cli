## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Execution Governance Regression

The regression harness SHALL capture and replay governed execution envelopes, policy decisions, approval decisions, scheduler events, bus records, audit summaries, outputs, errors, cancellations, retries, and rollback markers.

regression harness 必须捕获并回放 governed execution envelopes、policy decisions、approval decisions、scheduler events、bus records、audit summaries、outputs、errors、cancellations、retries 和 rollback markers。

#### Scenario: Direct execution bypass is tested

- **WHEN** architecture lint is run
- **THEN** regression tests prove direct governed primitive calls outside approved owners, tests, deterministic fakes, or owning packages fail with stable rule ids

#### Scenario: Governed replay compares decisions

- **WHEN** a governed capability scenario is replayed
- **THEN** the harness compares normalized invocation metadata, policy decisions, scheduler decisions, events, results, and redacted failures without live external services
